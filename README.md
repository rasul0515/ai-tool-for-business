#  AI Tool for Business

A small project built with FastAPI that offers simple AI-style tools to make business tasks easier.  



##  What it does

- **Summarize** — takes long text and gives you a short summary.  
- **Extract Invoice** — pulls out invoice number, date, total, and vendor from raw text.  
- **Lead Score** — checks sales notes and gives a quick “buying intent” score.
